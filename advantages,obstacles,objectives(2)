points for advantages,obstacles,objectives

advantages:
-execution of a task is much faster than a classical computer
-using qubits instead of ions cause exponential speedup and can handle larger numbers of calculations
-classical algorithm calculations are performed with ease and in greater amounts

obstacles:
-the technology required is not yet availabe - help prevent the electron from getting damaged before being used
-the cost to buy and run this technology is a very large amount
-if the wrong people develope this technology first,they will be untraceable and will have the ability to hack any network

objectives: (update)
-profit 
-income into countries
